YouTube Content Automation 

Creating engaging educational videos is often time-consuming, involving scripting, narration, and editing. This project automates the entire processâ€”taking a topic as input and generating a complete 30-second video with audio narration, relevant visuals, and metadata including title, description, and tags. The system uses AI to write scripts, convert them to speech, and generate dynamic video content automatically.

The tool supports multiple Class 12 Physics topics such as Electric Charges and Fields, Current Electricity, and Electromagnetic Induction. It allows educators to produce consistent, high-quality short-form content efficiently, making it easier to support student learning at scale.
